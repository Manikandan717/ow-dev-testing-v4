                        Deep learning has been very successful when working with images as data and is currently at a
                        stage where it works better than humans on multiple use-cases. The most important problems that
                        humans have been interested in solving with computer vision are image classification, object
                        detection and segmentation in the increasing order of their difficulty.

                        interested in getting the
                        labels of all the objects that are present in an image. In object detection we come further and
                        try to know along with what all objects that are present in an image, the location at which the
                        objects are present with the help of bounding boxes. <a href="/data-sourcing.html" class="cardtitle">Image segmentation</a> takes it to a new level
                        by trying to find out accurately the exact boundary of the objects in the image.

                            classifying each
                            pixel belonging to a particular
                            label. It doesn’t different across different instances of the same object. For example if
                            there are 2 cats in an image, semantic segmentation gives same label to all the pixels of
                            both cats</li>
                        <li class="blog_font"><strong>Instance segmentation :-</strong>Instance segmentation differs
                            from semantic
                            segmentation in the sense that it gives a unique
                            label to every instance of a particular object in the image. As can be seen in the image
                            above all 3 dogs are assigned different colors i.e different labels. With semantic
                            segmentation all of them would have been assigned the same color.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class=" blog_font">There are numerous advances in Segmentation algorithms and open
                        source
                        datasets. But to solve a particular problem in your domain, you will still need human labeled
                        images or human based verification. In this article, we will go through some of the nuances in
                        segmentation task labeling and how human based workforce can work in tandem with machine
                        learning based approaches.</p>
                    <p class=" mt-5 blog_font">To train your machine learning model, you need high quality
                        labels.
                        For a
                        successful data labeling project for segmentation depends on three key ingredients.</p>

                    <p class=" mt-3 blog_font">There are many open source and commercially available tools
                        on the
                        market. At objectways, we train our workforce using Open CVAT that provides a polygon tool with
                        interpolation and assistive tooling that gives 4x better speed at labeling and then we use a
                        tool that fits the use case.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" mt-3 blog_font">Here are the leading tools that we recommend for labeling.
                        For
                        efficient labeling, prefer a tool that allows pre-labeling and assistive labeling using
                        techniques like <a href="#" class="Objectways">Deep Extreme Cut</a> or <a href="#"
                            class="Objectways">Grab cut</a> and good review capabilities such as per label
                        opacity controls.

                    <h2 class="blog-title1 mt-4">Workforce training</h2>
                    <p class=" mt-3 blog_font">While it is easier to train a resource to perform simple
                        image tasks
                        such as classification or bounding boxes, segmentation tasks require more training as it
                        involves multiple mechanisms to optimize time, increase efficiency and reduce worker fatigue.
                        Here are some simple training techniques
                    </p>
                    <ul class="check1">
                        <li class="blog_font"><strong>Utilize Assistive Tooling:</strong> An annotator may start with a
                            simple brush or
                            polygon tool which they find easy to pick up.
                            But at volume, these tools tend to induce muscle fatigue hence it is important to make use
                            of assistive tooling.</li>
                        <li class="blog_font"><strong>Gradually introduce complex tasks:</strong> Annotators are always
                            good at doing the
                            same task more efficiently with time and should be
                            part of the training program. At Objectways, we tend to start training by introducing
                            annotators with simple images with relatively easy shapes(Cars/Buses/Roads) and migrate them
                            to using complex shapes such as vegetation, barriers.</li>
                        <li class="blog_font"><strong>Use variety of available open source pre-labeled
                                datasets:</strong> It is also
                            important to train the workforce using different datasets and we use <a

                            annotators with 99.99% accuracy and use it to provide feedback for annotators during the

                        evaluate the results of a model.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" mt-3 blog_font"><strong>Pixel accuracy:</strong> Pixel accuracy is the most
                        basic
                        metric which can be
                        used to validate the results. Accuracy is obtained by taking the ratio of correctly classified
                        pixels w.r.t total pixels.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" mt-3 blog_font"><strong>Intersection over Union:</strong> IOU is defined as
                        the ratio
                        of intersection
                        of ground truth and predicted segmentation outputs over their union. If we are calculating for
                        multiple classes, the IOU of each class is calculated and their mean is taken. It is a better
                        metric compared to pixel accuracy as if every pixel is given as background in a 2 class input
                        the IOU value is (90/100+0/100)/2 i.e 45% IOU which gives a better representation as compared to
                        90% accuracy.</p>
                    <p class=" mt-3 blog_font"><strong>F1 Score:</strong> The metric popularly used in
                        classification
                        F1 Score can be
                        used for segmentation tasks as well to deal with class imbalance.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" mt-4 blog_font">If you have a labeled dataset, you can introduce a golden
                        set in the
                        labeling pipeline and use one of the scores to compare labels against your own ground truth. We
                        focus on following aspects to improve quality of labeling
                    </p>
                    <ul class="check1">
                        <li class="blog_font "><strong>Understand labeling instructions:</strong> Never underestimate
                            the importance of
                            good labeling
                            instructions. Typically instructions are authored by data scientists who are good at
                            expressing what they want with examples. The human brain has a natural tendency to give
                            weight to (and remember) negative experiences or interactions more than positive ones — they
                            stand out more. So, it is important to provide bad labeling examples. Reading instructions
                            carefully often weeds out many systemic errors across tasks.</li>
                        <li class="blog_font"><strong>Provide timely feedback:</strong> While many workforces use tiered
                            skill workforce
                            where level1
                            workforce are less experienced than quality control team, it is important to provide timely
                            feedback to level1 annotators so they understand unintentional labeling errors so they do
                            not make those errors in the future tasks</li>
                        <li class="blog_font"><strong>Rigorous Quality audits:</strong> Many tools provide nice metrics
                            to track label
                            addition/deletion or
                            change over time. Just as algorithms should converge and reduce the loss function, the time
                            to QC a particular task and suggested changes should converge to less than .01% error rate.
                            At objectways, we have dedicated QC and super QC teams who have a consistent track record to
                            achieve over 99% accuracy.</li>
